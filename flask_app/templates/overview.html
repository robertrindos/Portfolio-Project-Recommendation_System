      This application was crafted with accuracy and efficiency in mind, to provide movie suggestions based off of the user's input. Utilizing a python back-end and Google Cloud services, this application has plenty of big data computations under the hood. A Python script processes large quantities of data at a time, so it is set to run periodically with the help of Cloud Scheduler. The data is processed in a batch and stored within Cloud Storage, allowing quick data retrieval through the Python Flask API. This API script is much faster than the processing script because it has much less computations and has to do mostly with data retrieval using two relational datasets. The API is essentially an interactive Flask app that can retrieve and display movie suggestions, based off the scores given in the processing script. Although, I am not a frontend developer by any means, I gave it a shot by making this web app by utilizing Bootstraps for HTML and CSS. Feel free to explore the code at my GitHub repository listed below. If you would like to learn more about me, you can click on the "Developer Info" link at the top of the page.
